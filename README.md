# Calculator App

This project is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides basic arithmetic operations and mimics the design provided in the Figma reference.

## Features

- **Numeric Input:** Buttons for digits `0-9` to input numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Delete Functionality:** A `DEL` button to delete the last entered character from the display.
- **Reset Functionality:** A `RESET` button to clear the display and reset it to the default value `0`.
- **Calculate Functionality:** A `=` button to evaluate the arithmetic expression and display the result.
- **Error Handling:** Displays `Error` if the input expression is invalid.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the file in a modern web browser.
3. Use the calculator buttons to perform calculations.

### Example

1. Input: `8 + 2`
2. Press `=`
3. Output: `10`

## File Structure

```
.
├── index.html  # Main HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the application.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and logic.

## How to Run Locally

1. Download the code or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/palakpatel01/Calculator/tree/main>
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- Add advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, power).
- Improve UI/UX with animations.
- Support for keyboard input.
- Unit tests for validation and calculations.
